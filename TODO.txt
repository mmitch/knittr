TODO:

=== build ===

generate "lightweight" JARs

=== KNITTR ===

- SVG render:
  - fix bug on rescale of last page when there is only one page left
    (then only 1 page is rendered and it is not scaled to fit)
  - show progress bar during rendering (busy cursor is not enough)

- main window:
  - closing the window via window manager (eg. [X] under Windows) does not
    show the "unsaved changed - really quit?" dialog, but quits unconditionally

- build:
  - check-l10n: only call with path, detect and sort relevant files automatically
  - remove hardcoded path from full build Ant XML

? allow "print two pages wide"?

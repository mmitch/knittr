TODO:

=== KNITTR ===

- SVG render:
  - fix bug on rescale of last page when there is only one page left
    (then only 1 page is rendered and it is not scaled to fit)

? allow "print two pages wide"?

=== UI ===

- print validation error for every element
  - validate/invalidate directly on value change
  - remove FormattedTextFieldVerifier class

- cascade validation errors
  - mark groups (eg. tabs) as invalid, if a value is invalid
  - use a lighter red and "$NUMBER errors" as tooltip

- add detailed field description as tooltip to label part of a DataBinding

- do something when image file is no image file (preview icon == null)

- later: improve controls/bindings
  - variable text on "..." buttons in ColorBinding and FileBinding
  - provide a combined slider/textfield input for IntBinding and FloatBinding 

- later: use message footer to print help text/validation error for current element

=== DATA ===

- additional constraints
  ! check this, there is already something like this code (source file != target file)
    but does not seem to work
  - free code
  - not directly related to an attribute
  - e.g. "page border must be smaller than page width and page height"
  ? how to set/unset validation flag in UI (on which attribute for example)

? "editable" attribute for all attribute types

? persist DataModel in text/properties file, don't use object serialization
  - pro: manual editing possible
  - serialized Java objects should be forward-compatible through JRE versions

=== LIB ===

- document all library classes and methods

? simple logging framework

? general utilities class (like safe String.setToMxLength())

? general methods for look&feel selection / AutoLayout selection

=== BUILD ===

- check-l10n: only call with path, detect and sort relevant files automatically

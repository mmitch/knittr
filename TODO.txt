TODO:

=== KNITTR ===

- SVG render:
  - fix bug on rescale of last page when there is only one page left
    (then only 1 page is rendered and it is not scaled to fit)

? allow "print two pages wide"?

=== UI ===

- i18n
  - property handling for lib (exceptions, validation)

- print validation error for every element
  - needs message footer
  - needs parseValue()
  - change validate() to validate(Object)
  - remove FormattedTextFieldVerifier class
  - mark groups (eg. tabs) as invalid, if a value is invalid
  - later: use message footer to print help text for current element

=== DATA ===

- additional constraints
  - free code
  - not directly related to an attribute
  - e.g. "page border must be smaller than page width and page height"
  ? how to set/unset validation flag in UI (on which attribute for example)

? "editable" attribute for all attribute types

? persist DataModel in text/properties file, don't use object serialization
  - pro: manual editing possible
  - serialized Java objects should be forward-compatible through JRE versions

=== LIB ===

- document all library classes and methods

? simple logging framework

? general utilities class (like safe String.setToMxLength())

? general methods for look&feel selection / AutoLayout selection

=== BUILD ===

- check-l10n: only call with path, detect and sort relevant files automatically
